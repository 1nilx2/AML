Bayesian Decision Rule

Given the X vector (dimension of D), 
Bayes dicidion rule choose the class such that the posteior probability is largest with the class. 
Posterior = (C<sub>i</sub>|**X**) 
          = (**X**,C<sub>i</sub>)/p(**X**) 
          = (**X**|C<sub>i</sub>)*p(C<sub>i</sub>)/p(**X**)

When it comes to comparing the higher probability of class member ship, p(**X**) doesn't need to be considered. 
Thus, the focus of issue will be compressed into a joint probability
